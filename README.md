GAMA-Site
=========

My personal experimental website for learning php among other functions.

Included in this repository is a full index clone of my website, with uploaded and un-needed content removed.

This is where I have all my stuff for the most part, over the past two weeks I've spent most of my time on the image host, found in the img directory

Included are:
/
| Standard index.php with site.css
| copy of index.php when site was hacked 
| custom 404 error page
| mcping - Minecraft server checker
| testserver.php - tests any ip address and port supplied to it
| upload.php and upload.html - used to upload files into the upload dir

/img
| index.php - most stuff happens here, semi-dynamic 
| getfiles.php - does a host of things from listing uploaded files with links to listing upload date for each file
| imgup.php - image uploader script from: Scott Lucht <scott@phphq.net> http://www.phphq.net

Site has more than this, but is both beyond the scope of this project, and isn't something I'm messing with.
