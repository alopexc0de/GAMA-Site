Included in this repository is a full index clone of my website, with uploaded and un-needed content removed.

This is where I have all my stuff for the most part, over the past two weeks I've spent most of my time on the image host, found in the img directory

The site has more than this, but is both beyond the scope of this project, and isn't something I'm messing with.
